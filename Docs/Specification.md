We at NetPort are partners in a project called DIA that is funded by Vinnova and managed by Malmö Högskola. The project involves about fifteen partners in Skåne and Blekinge, and NetPort are responsible for all activities in Blekinge. The goal is to create simple prototypes of data-driven services for ”people in motion”. 

One activity focus is tourism. Together with the local tourism organisations in Blekinge and the city of Malmö we want to look at ”tracks” of movement among tourists. To achieve this we wish to create a simple iPhone application that tracks a device’s movements, which we will test on a small group of people for a limited time. Collected data will be used for analysis and discussions with our partners to guide and motivate further development. 

We want your help with developing the iPhone application. This is what it should do:
— Upon first startup register the device with a server and ask for permission to log the user’s movements in the background
— Stay running until the user turns it off
— Show a button to toggle location tracking on/off
— Send tracking data to our backend
— Be deployed through TestFlight (because it’s not meant to ever reach the App Store)

We have a developer account registered with NetPort, which I can make you part of. We are currently recruiting groups of test subjects in Blekinge and Malmö, and I’ll be responsible for getting them up and running when we begin testing. 

The backend is not yet defined so I’m open for any suggestions on how to set it up. If applicable, you are welcome to quote that part as well. I’m thinking it’s just a simple database with an API. 

Our timeframe is that the application should be ready for deployment by March, then tested throughout March–April, and finally closed by May.
